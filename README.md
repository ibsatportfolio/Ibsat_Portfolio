# [Project 1: # Image Caption Generator: Project Overview](https://github.com/ibsatportfolio/ibsat.git)
 ### Whenever an image appears in front of us our brain is capable of annotating or labeling it, but what about computers? 
 ### Now it is possible for computers to process an image and label it with a highly relevant and accurate caption.
 ### •	Created a tool which is capable of generate very relevant captions for the image with the help of datasets.
 ### •	Used two techniques of Deep learning including LSTM a type of Recurrent Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
 ### •	This system includes the labeling of an image with English keywords with the help of datasets provided during model training. 
 ### •	Flickr 8k dataset is used to train the CNN model called VGG16. 
 ### •	VGG16 is responsible for image feature extraction. These extracted features will be fed to the LSTM model which in turn generates the image caption.
