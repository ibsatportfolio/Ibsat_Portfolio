Machine Learning and Data Science Projects


# [Project 1: Image Caption Generator](https://github.com/ibsatportfolio/ibsat.git)
## Project Overview:
*Whenever an image appears in front of us our brain is capable of annotating or labeling it, but what about computers?*

Now it is possible for computers to process an image and label it with a highly relevant and accurate caption.
- Created a tool which is capable of generate very relevant captions for the image with the help of datasets.
- Used two techniques of Deep learning including **LSTM** a type of Recurrent Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
- This system includes the labeling of an image with English keywords with the help of datasets provided during model training. 
- Flickr 8k dataset is used to train the CNN model called VGG16. 
- **VGG16** is responsible for image feature extraction. These extracted features will be fed to the LSTM model which in turn generates the image caption.

# [Project 2: Heart Disease Prediction (Classification Problem)](https://github.com/ibsatportfolio/Project-1.git)
## Project Overview:
*Let's say a big hospital wants to invest some time in ML for System that can Predict wether someone has heart disease or not.*<br>
So in this project we can predict Heart Diseases in people. By using different Machine learning Algorithms.<br>
- A system which is capable to predict whether or not someone has heart disease
- Used the dataset that contain all the patients health record
- Many machine learning algorithms for prediction of heart disease
- I have used **KNN**, **RandomForestClassifier** and **LogisticRegression** models
### All models scores
