# [Project 1: Image Caption Generator](https://github.com/ibsatportfolio/ibsat.git)
## Project Overview:
Whenever an image appears in front of us our brain is capable of annotating or labeling it, but what about computers?

Now it is possible for computers to process an image and label it with a highly relevant and accurate caption.
- Created a tool which is capable of generate very relevant captions for the image with the help of datasets.
- Used two techniques of Deep learning including LSTM a type of Recurrent Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
- This system includes the labeling of an image with English keywords with the help of datasets provided during model training. 
- Flickr 8k dataset is used to train the CNN model called VGG16. 
- VGG16 is responsible for image feature extraction. These extracted features will be fed to the LSTM model which in turn generates the image caption.
